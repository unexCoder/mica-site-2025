Vitamin C plays a crucial role in collagen production, promotes wound healing, and enhances immune system function. Additionally, lemon pulp contains organic acids, primarily citric acid and, to a lesser extent, malic acid, which are responsible for its characteristic sour taste, as well as acetic and formic acids.",
                        "Kiwi is rich in vitamin C, vitamins E and K, folates, carotenoids, fiber, and other phytochemicals. Its consumption has beneficial effects on gastrointestinal function, aiding in protein digestion and relieving constipation. It also contributes positively to upper respiratory tract health, helping prevent infections and improving symptoms.",
                        "Strawberries stand out not only for their vibrant appearance and sweet-tart flavor but also for their high vitamin and mineral content. They contain vitamins A, C, and E, as well as B-complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, and B6), along with essential minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iodine, antioxidants, fiber, and folic acid. As a seasonal fruit, strawberries offer numerous health benefits. Besides being a nutritious dietary option, they act as a natural disinfectant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifier. Their properties help dissolve kidney and gallstones, support liver function, and contribute to managing conditions such as hypertension and fluid retention."

This conductivity is measured in real-time using specialized sensors (conductivity, electrochemical, and voltage sensors) connected to an Arduino platform. The sensors, immersed in test tubes with the respective juices, detect variations in electrical resistance, translating the ionic properties of each fruit into analog signals.",
                        "These electrical signals are converted into digital values and transmitted to the Arduino programming environment for monitoring. The data is then sent to SuperCollider, an audio synthesis programming environment, where an algorithm translates the input into frequencies within the pink noise spectrum. The signal intensity is directly related to the conductivity of each fruit: the higher the ion concentration, the higher the voltage, resulting in a more dynamic and complex sound response.",
                        "Each fruit functions as a unique signal source, as its acidic and mineral composition defines its electrical behavior. Due to its high acidity, lemon typically generates a stronger signal compared to kiwi or strawberry. The system interprets these variations as dynamic parameters within the algorithm, modifying the sound in real-time according to electrochemical fluctuations. Through this process, the project transforms chemical properties into auditory experiences, exploring the intersection between nature and technology."

By converting bioelectrical signals into audible frequencies, the project demonstrates the potential of using natural elements as musical instruments. The real-time modulation of sound, influenced by the inherent chemical composition of fruits, creates an evolving and organic soundscape.",

This fusion of science, art, and technology fosters a deeper appreciation of the bioelectric nature of organic matter, illustrating how data-driven compositions can emerge from seemingly ordinary elements.",
                        "By bridging the gap between natural processes and digital sound manipulation, this performance underscores the artistic potential of scientific exploration. The result is a constantly shifting soundscape that reflects the subtle yet intricate interactions within biological systems, offering a unique auditory experience that blurs the boundaries between the organic and the synthetic."

                        "Algorithmic Noise is a research-creation project that explores noise as an aesthetic, philosophical, and algorithmic phenomenon—working from within code itself. It is not merely about generating noise as a visual or sonic result, but about approaching it as a conceptual tool: a force that disrupts, complicates, and opens up new possibilities. Through programming as a living language, the project intervenes in the logic of software, pushing its functions beyond their limits and exploring the expressive potential of error, saturation, distortion, and excess. Code is not treated as a neutral technical instrument, but as a symbolic and structural space where the unexpected can emerge. Writing code becomes a performative act, where the programmer operates as an explorer of the system’s edges, bending structures until something unforeseen surfaces. Instead of pursuing efficiency or cleanliness, the project embraces complexity, margin, and noise as an alternative form of sensitivity—one that can activate new ways of perceiving and thinking.",
                        "This proposal unfolds at the intersection of generative art, creative programming, and critical reflection on the systems that shape our lives. In a world deeply mediated by algorithms that sort, filter, and normalize reality, introducing noise also means introducing dissent. It is a way to resist the homogenization of experience and to open cracks in the narratives of transparency, control, and optimization. Algorithmic Noise inhabits code through uncertainty, instability, and ambiguity, questioning both the technical conventions and the ideological frameworks that underpin them. It asks: What does noise reveal about the systems we inhabit? How can error become a creative force? What kind of sensitivity emerges when code allows itself to be contaminated by chaos? In this context, noise is not only an aesthetic—it's also a stance: a way of thinking with and against the languages that structure our digital experience."

This ongoing exchange transforms code into a live instrument, a language that is spoken and shaped in the moment. Each line typed becomes an action, each syntax variation a sonic possibility. Rather than following a predetermined path, the performance unfolds as an open system—sensitive to context, error, and spontaneity. The act of coding becomes visible and audible, turning the stage into a shared space where the logic of software is exposed and challenged. What emerges is a soundscape that is immersive, unpredictable, and in constant transformation, engaging the audience in a unique process of real-time algorithmic improvisation.",
                        "These performances, presented across various venues and festivals in Europe and beyond, propose a radical approach to electronic sound and digital aesthetics. By using code as a performative and expressive tool, I explore the boundaries between control and chaos, structure and deviation. The algorithms act not only as compositional frameworks but also as agents of disruption—capable of collapsing, mutating, or overflowing their own logic. Each session becomes a sonic laboratory, where the machine's behavior is not only orchestrated but provoked. This method opens a space for listening that is both critical and embodied, where technology is not hidden behind polished interfaces but exposed in its raw, generative state. Livecoding, in this sense, is not just a way of producing sound—it's a way of thinking, performing, and experiencing the algorithm as a living, unstable force."
