                {"chapter":"About the Samples",
                "body":["Lemons provide a significant amount of vitamins C and K, along with smaller amounts of other vitamins and minerals. Vitamin C plays a crucial role in collagen production, promotes wound healing, and enhances immune system function. Additionally, lemon pulp contains organic acids, primarily citric acid and, to a lesser extent, malic acid, which are responsible for its characteristic sour taste, as well as acetic and formic acids.",
                "Kiwi is rich in vitamin C, vitamins E and K, folates, carotenoids, fiber, and other phytochemicals. Its consumption has beneficial effects on gastrointestinal function, aiding in protein digestion and relieving constipation. It also contributes positively to upper respiratory tract health, helping prevent infections and improving symptoms.",
                "Strawberries stand out not only for their vibrant appearance and sweet-tart flavor but also for their high vitamin and mineral content. They contain vitamins A, C, and E, as well as B-complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, and B6), along with essential minerals such as iron, calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, iodine, antioxidants, fiber, and folic acid. As a seasonal fruit, strawberries offer numerous health benefits. Besides being a nutritious dietary option, they act as a natural disinfectant, anti-inflammatory, and detoxifier. Their properties help dissolve kidney and gallstones, support liver function, and contribute to managing conditions such as hypertension and fluid retention."]},

                {"chapter":"Measuring Fruit Conductivity Using Sensors and Arduino",
                "body":["Lemon, kiwi, and strawberry juice contain natural electrolytes that facilitate the flow of electric current. This conductivity is measured in real-time using specialized sensors (conductivity, electrochemical, and voltage sensors) connected to an Arduino platform. The sensors, immersed in test tubes with the respective juices, detect variations in electrical resistance, translating the ionic properties of each fruit into analog signals.",
                "These electrical signals are converted into digital values and transmitted to the Arduino programming environment for monitoring. The data is then sent to SuperCollider, an audio synthesis programming environment, where an algorithm translates the input into frequencies within the pink noise spectrum. The signal intensity is directly related to the conductivity of each fruit: the higher the ion concentration, the higher the voltage, resulting in a more dynamic and complex sound response.",
                "Each fruit functions as a unique signal source, as its acidic and mineral composition defines its electrical behavior. Due to its high acidity, lemon typically generates a stronger signal compared to kiwi or strawberry. The system interprets these variations as dynamic parameters within the algorithm, modifying the sound in real-time according to electrochemical fluctuations. Through this process, the project transforms chemical properties into auditory experiences, exploring the intersection between nature and technology."]},
                {"chapter":"Expanding the Concept: Nature as a Sound Generator",
                "body":["This experimental approach not only highlights the conductive properties of organic substances but also expands the possibilities of data-driven sound art. By converting bioelectrical signals into audible frequencies, the project demonstrates the potential of using natural elements as musical instruments. The real-time modulation of sound, influenced by the inherent chemical composition of fruits, creates an evolving and organic soundscape.",
                "The PinkNoiser Live Set challenges conventional perceptions of sound synthesis, inviting the audience to interact with the hidden electrical properties of everyday foods. This fusion of science, art, and technology fosters a deeper appreciation of the bioelectric nature of organic matter, illustrating how data-driven compositions can emerge from seemingly ordinary elements.",
                "By bridging the gap between natural processes and digital sound manipulation, this performance underscores the artistic potential of scientific exploration. The result is a constantly shifting soundscape that reflects the subtle yet intricate interactions within biological systems, offering a unique auditory experience that blurs the boundaries between the organic and the synthetic."]}

                "body":["BioCode is a hybrid art project that explores the intersection between nature, technology, and human perception. Situated at the crossroads of bioart and post-nature, it transforms the invisible signals of plants into immersive sound experiences, inviting us to reflect on our relationship with the vegetal world.","By merging disciplines such as biology, music, technology, and contemporary art, BioCode converts the micro-electrical fluctuations generated by plants into musical compositions. This process not only translates biological activity into sound but also proposes a new way of listening to and feeling vegetal life—revealing a hidden dimension that often goes unnoticed."]},
                {"chapter":"Hybrid Art: A Space of Convergence",
                "body":["In BioCode, hybrid art is not merely the blending of techniques or disciplines; it is a space of convergence where science and creativity engage in dialogue. Using biofeedback technologies, we capture the bioelectrical fluctuations of plants—signals that are typically imperceptible to humans—and transform them into unique sonic landscapes.","Here, technology becomes a bridge for living organisms to actively participate in the creative process. BioCode does not impose a unidirectional message but instead creates a platform for plants to express themselves through their own bioelectrical language."]},
                {"chapter":"Bioart and Post-Nature: A New Perspective on Life",
                "body":["Bioart is an artistic movement that reflects on the relationship between life, science, and art. BioCode embraces this approach by using living organisms as essential elements in its creative process, allowing plants to symbolically 'speak' through music.","At the same time, the concept of post-nature recognizes that the environment we inhabit has been profoundly reshaped by human activity. In this context, BioCode poses a fundamental question: How can we reconnect with the forms of life that coexist with us in an increasingly technologized world?"]},
                {"chapter":"Plant Philosophy and Vegetal Intelligence","body":["Western philosophy has historically regarded plants as passive beings, devoid of perception or consciousness. However, recent studies in biology and ecology have revealed that plants are extraordinarily sensitive and intelligent organisms.","Philosopher Michael Marder, in his work Plant-Thinking, argues that plants possess a non-discursive form of thought—a kind of wisdom expressed through their biological rhythms, environmental interactions, and responses to stimuli. Similarly, Stefano Mancuso, a pioneer in plant neurobiology, has shown that plants can learn, remember, and adapt to their surroundings without the need for a central nervous system."]},
                {"chapter":"Vegetal Sensitivities and Deep Listening","body":["Plants perceive the world in ways we are only beginning to understand. They can detect sound vibrations, respond to changes in light, and react to chemical signals in the air. BioCode invites us into a practice of 'deep listening'—to connect with these vegetal sensitivities by translating their bioelectrical responses into sound experiences.","This listening involves an openness to a new relationship with our surroundings—where nature is no longer a passive resource but an active interlocutor. Through the music generated by BioCode, we seek to cultivate greater awareness and empathy toward plant life."]},
                {"chapter":"A Sensory Dialogue Between Humans and Plants","body":["The main objective of BioCode is to create a symbolic communication channel between humans and plant species. Through these sound experiences, we aim to blur the boundaries between the human and the non-human, encouraging the audience to question their perception of nature and explore new forms of interspecies empathy.","In a world where digital technologies often distance us from nature, BioCode offers a path toward sensory reconnection: to listen to plants, perceive their hidden vitality, and understand that nature—despite its constant transformation—still speaks a language of its own, waiting to be uncovered."]},
                {"chapter":"Technology and Process: Sonification of Biological Data","body":["BioCode uses technology to translate biological signals from plants into immersive sonic experiences. This process, known as biological data sonification, converts internal activity from living organisms into audible frequencies, revealing a hidden layer of the vegetal world.","We work with specialized sensors that capture real-time physiological activity in plants. These sensors integrate with open hardware platforms like Arduino and open-source software tools like SuperCollider, enabling the processing, interpretation, and transformation of raw data into generative soundscapes."]},
                {"chapter":"Biological Parameters Measured in Plants","body":["Bioelectricity: Capturing micro-electrical fluctuations to analyze bioelectrical activity and responses to external stimuli.","Temperature and Humidity: Monitoring environmental conditions that affect plant physiology.","Magnetic Fields: Exploring electromagnetic interactions in living organisms.","Light and Spectral Intensity: Measuring wavelength effects on photosynthesis and growth.","Photosynthetic Activity: Recording the efficiency of light capture and conversion into chemical energy.","Gas Exchange: Analyzing absorption and emission of gases like CO₂ and O₂.","Conductivity and pH: Evaluating electrochemical properties and ionic balance.","Soil Ion Composition: Measuring macronutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).","Vibration and Mechanical Response: Studying reactions to physical stimuli, including touch and motion.","Action Potential: Recording bioelectrical signals in stimulus-sensitive species.","Galvanic Skin Response (in plants): Monitoring internal moisture and electrical conductivity variations."]},
                {"chapter":"Sensor Development and Biointerfaces for Plant Signal Detection","body":["As part of this research, I am designing and fabricating customized sensors for measuring bioelectrical and physiological signals in plants. The aim is to expand sensing capabilities and interpret the 'emotions' of plants through electrical, chemical, and mechanical patterns.","These next-generation sensors are engineered to overcome the limitations of conventional devices by providing more accurate readings of action potentials, bioelectrical fluctuations, and internal conductivity shifts—adapted to the structural and physiological features of each plant species.","Beyond sensor development, the project also explores new interfaces and biointerfaces, merging technology with living systems to foster more dynamic interactions between plants and their environment. By combining flexible electronics, nanotechnology, and bioelectrical communication systems, we investigate how these interfaces can not only measure signals but also stimulate and respond in real-time.","This line of experimentation has applications in both generative art and music, as well as in the scientific study of plant behavior. By creating advanced sensors and integrating them into innovative biointerfaces, BioCode enables a deeper exploration of plant bioelectricity, bringing us closer to understanding their reactivity, communication, and cognitive potential within their ecosystems."]}
